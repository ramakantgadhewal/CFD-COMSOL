Dsesign of small-scale wind tunnel

 emulate real-life project

will be used for design of real wind tunnel next sprign

rectangular cross-section, venturi tube (ish)
stationary study, lowers comp time


report grading
focus on quality of report, he is not that familiar with the subject (though he has done the course)
eric does the grading to keep it anonymous and to give krister more free time to help.


point system, based on criteria on canvas
reduce points, feedback, room for imptrovement, should be motivated. 

bonus system: 
	reward: goor results, ambition, well written, etc
	injector simulation
	one grad(e) available (20%)

start with 80 points, reduce for errors, 16 more bonus points. 80 is 100%. voluntary 3D sim will heavily infuence bonus points

changes: 
3D injector
more focus on creativity and good sim
imitate real life
less ambiguity (grading critera)

result and diskussion (they force is to separate result&discussion)
majority of points
separate section

preparation for master thesis
will be high level

grading criteria
equal weight betwewen project and exam
if failed on first try or turned in late, only pass is possible grade
mxa 15 pages

common room for improvement sections
text should cover the results, the figures are just for support
references: IEEE system, use the references more than you think. eg "DNS-data from [7] blabla"
